## inform: A sentiment analysis Chrome extension
inform is a Chrome extension that analyzes the news articles you read for objectivity analysis. As media becomes more politically polarized, it is important for readers to develop opinions based on truthful information. This extension highlights overly emotional and subjective text using natural language processing so that you can be aware of what is biased and stay informed.


Update: inform has won 3rd place for "Best Text Objectivity Analysis"! See the Devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/hackutd6 "HackUTD VI").
